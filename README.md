This is design entry to ARM design competition.

I build a prototype of flower watering system based on:
- 100MHz ARM microcontroller with 512KB Flash and 128KB RAM
- windscreen wiper pump
- servo to make the shadow over the flower
- solar battery as the light sensor
- simple moisture sensor (2 nails in soil with ADC)

System features:
- build in web server (lwIP)
- realtime operating system (RTX)
- auto watering schedule based on web setting
- auto shadow in harsh light conditions
- manual actions thru web page

This project is spoiled with autogenerated drivers from HW vendor (Infineon) 
but I decided to keep it in git because API is unstable and there is no guarantee my code will work with up to date libraries. 

All actual code is in Thread_ files.
